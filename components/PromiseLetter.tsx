{`Misha,

This isn’t a dramatic promise.
It’s a quiet one.

I promise to listen even when I don’t understand.
To stay when things feel heavy.
To laugh with you on silly days,
and hold you gently on the difficult ones.

I promise effort.
I promise honesty.
And most of all —
I promise choosing you, again and again,
even when it’s not easy.

Always,
Me 🤍`}
